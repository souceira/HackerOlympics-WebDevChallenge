                <p><h2>Pesto Pasta</h2></p>
                <img src="pesto copy.jpg" alt="pesto" width="345" height="345">
                <b><h3>Ingredients</3></b>
                <p>▢ 1 quantity homemade pesto</p>
                <p>▢ 300 - 350 g / 10 - 12 oz pasta of choice (such as ziti, penne and spaghetti)</p>
                <p>▢ 2 tsp salt</p>
                <p>▢ 3/4 cup pasta cooking water</p>
                <p>▢ Parmesan, for serving</p>

                <b><h4>Instructions</h4></b>
                <p>1. Bring a large pot of water to the boil with the salt.</p>
                <p>2. Add pasta and cook for the length of time per the packet.</p>
                <p>3. Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of of the pasta cooking water.</p>
                <p>4. Drain pasta in a colander, leave it for a minute.</p>
                <p>5. Transfer pasta to a bowl (do not use pasta cooking pot, too hot).</p>
                <p>6. Add pesto and 1/4 cup of pasta water. Toss to coat pasta in pesto, adding more water if required to make pasta silky and saucy, rather than dry and sticky.</p>
                <p>7. Taste, add more salt and pepper if desired.</p>
                <p>8. Serve immediately, garnished with fresh parmesan.</p>

                <h4><b>Recipe Notes: </h4></b>
                <p>1. <b>Pesto</b> - This recipe is intended for use with this homemade pesto which I also shared today. But the same technique applies to store bought. If using store bought, use 1/2 cup+. Usually require less than when using homemade because they have a more concentrated flavour from basil extract.</p>
                <p>2. <b>Pasta</b> - Ziti and penne are my favourites for pesto (explained in post). Spaghetti is next, then other long strand pastas.</p>
                <p>Use 300g/10oz for a really great coating of pesto sauce - 3 large servings, 4 smallish servings.</p>
                <p>Use up to 350g/12oz for "normal" amount of pesto sauce to pasta - 4 standard servings.</p>
                <p><Don't use more pasta for one batch of homemade pesto, the pasta will lack pesto flavour.</p>
                <h4><b>General:</b></h4>
                <p>Never toss pesto pasta on a hot stove, heat will make basil black!</p>
                <p>Some people like a squeeze of lemon juice to finish</p>
                <p>Leftovers - store in fridge in super airtight container</p>
                <p>Do not reheat leftovers - will also make basil black. Just bring to room temp then consume - pesto pasta at room temp is so good!</p>

                    <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li> 
                    <li>1 whole garlic, crushed</li> 
                    <li>2 pcs star anise</li> 
                    <li>3 pcs bay leaf</li> 
                    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li> 
                    <li>1 tsp peppercorns</li> 
                    <li>3 cups water</li> 
                    <li>cooking oil</li>
                </ul>
            <h4><b>Vinegar Dip:</h4></p>

                    <li>3 birds-eye chillies, chopped with seeds</li> 
                    <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>

                    <li>freshly ground black pepper</li> 
                </ul>

                <ol>
                    <li>Place ribs in a pot and add enough water to cover the beef, bring it to a boil and let the scum rise. Turn the heat off, drain the liquid out and rinse beef with running tap water.</li>

                <h3>Pesto Pasta</h3>
                <img src="images/pesto.jpg" alt="pesto" width="345" height="345">
                <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 quantity homemade pesto</li>
                    <li>300 - 350 g / 10 - 12 oz pasta of choice (such as ziti, penne and spaghetti)</li>
                    <li>2 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup pasta cooking water</li>
                    <li>Parmesan, for serving</li>
                </ul>

                <b><h4>Instructions</h4></b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of water to the boil with the salt.</li>
                    <li>Add pasta and cook for the length of time per the packet.</li>
                    <li>Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of of the pasta cooking water.</li>
                    <li>Drain pasta in a colander, leave it for a minute.</li>
                    <li>Transfer pasta to a bowl (do not use pasta cooking pot, too hot).</li>
                    <li>Add pesto and 1/4 cup of pasta water. Toss to coat pasta in pesto, adding more water if required to make pasta silky and saucy, rather than dry and sticky.</li>
                    <li>Taste, add more salt and pepper if desired.</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately, garnished with fresh parmesan.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4><b>Recipe Notes: </h4></b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pesto - This recipe is intended for use with this homemade pesto which I also shared today. But the same technique applies to store bought. If using store bought, use 1/2 cup+. Usually require less than when using homemade because they have a more concentrated flavour from basil extract.</li>
                    <li>Pasta - Ziti and penne are my favourites for pesto (explained in post). Spaghetti is next, then other long strand pastas.</li>
                    <li>Use 300g/10oz for a really great coating of pesto sauce - 3 large servings, 4 smallish servings.</li>
                    <li>Use up to 350g/12oz for "normal" amount of pesto sauce to pasta - 4 standard servings.</li>
                    <li>Don't use more pasta for one batch of homemade pesto, the pasta will lack pesto flavour.</li>
                </ol>   

                <h4><b>General:</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some people like a squeeze of lemon juice to finish!</li>
                    <li>Leftovers - store in fridge in super airtight container.</li>
                    <li>Do not reheat leftovers - will also make basil black. Just bring to room temp then consume - pesto pasta at room temp is so good!</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is one of my favourite recipes to make for myself, my family, and for parties.

It's the perfect salad for year-round enjoyment. The best part of it is that this classic recipe is incredibly beginner-friendly.

                    <li>Cover and refrigerate the macaroni salad. I prefer to leave it overnight but at least an hour or two will do as well!</li>

                <p>One of my favourite dishes ever is Pani Puri - a very popular street dish from India. Pani-puri is also known by other names: in Gujarat (where I'm from), we call the dish "Pani Puri", but it is also known as "Paani Patashi," "Gup-chup," "Gol Gappe" (and more) in different parts of India!

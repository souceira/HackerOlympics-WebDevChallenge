        <h3>Pani Puri</h3>
        <img src = "images/panipuri.jpg" alt = "Pani Puri">
        <p>One of my favourite dishes ever is Pani Puri - a very popular street dish from India. Pani-puri is also known by other names: in Gujarat (where I'm from), we call the dish "Pani Puri", but it is also known as "Paani Patashi," "Gup-chup," "Gol Gappe" (and more) in different parts of India! As it is street-food, the dish is relatively easy to make - follow these simple steps to try Pani-puri in the comfort of your own home! </p>
